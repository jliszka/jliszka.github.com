      <h1>A Gentleman and a Scala<br/><small>Understanding math through code</small></h2>
    </div>
    <p>My name is Jason Liszka, and I&#8217;m a software engineer at Foursquare in New York. This blog chronicles my attempt to understand math better through code. I&#8217;ve always been interested in abstract math, but computation has always been more intuitive to me. Realizing abstract structures in code makes them more concrete and makes it easier for me to wrap my puny human brain around them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Scala and Haskell so you&#8217;ll see a lot of code in those languages.</p>

<p>You should <a href='http://twitter.com/jliszka'>follow me on twitter</a>. I promise I won&#8217;t spam your feed.</p>

<p>I also make no claims about being a gentleman, title of this blog notwithstanding.</p>

    <h2 class='title'>Good Tech Lead, Bad Tech Lead</h2>
    <p>A brief guide to tech leadership at Foursquare, inspired by Ben Horowitz’s <a href='http://benhorowitz.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/good-product-manager.pdf'>Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager</a>. Cross-posted from <a href='https://medium.com/p/948b2b806d86'>Medium</a>.</p>

<h3 id='teamwork'>Teamwork</h3>

<p>Good tech leads act as a member of the team, and consider themselves successful when the team is successful. They take their share of unsexy grungy work and clear roadblocks so their team can operate at 100%. They work to broaden the technical capabilities of their team, making sure knowledge of critical systems is not concentrated in one or two minds.</p>

<p>Bad tech leads take the high-profile tasks for themselves and are motivated by being able to take credit for doing the work. They optimize locally, keeping team members working on projects that benefit the team at the expense of the engineering organization at large.</p>

<h3 id='technical_vision'>Technical vision</h3>

<p>Good tech leads have an overall vision for the technical direction of the product and make sure the team understands it. They delegate feature areas to other team members and let them own their decisions. They recognize that their team members are smart, trust them, and rely on them to handle significant pieces of the project.</p>

<p>Bad tech leads resist explaining or clarifying the technical direction and dictate decisions instead. They keep critical institutional knowledge in their heads, failing to multiply their effectiveness by creating and disseminating helpful documentation.</p>

    <h2 class='title'>Bayesian networks and causality</h2>
    <p>Correlation does not imply causality—you&#8217;ve heard it a thousand times. But causality does imply correlation. Being good Bayesians, we should know how to turn a statement like that around and find a way to infer causality from correlation.</p>

<p>The tool we&#8217;re going to use to do this is called a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model'>probabilistic graphical model</a>. A PGM is a graph that encodes the causal relationships between events. For example, you might construct this graph to model a chain of causes resulting in someone getting a college scholarship:</p>

<p><img alt='A -&gt; B -&gt; C' src='/assets/img/pgm/sat.png' /></p>

<p>Or the relationship between diseases and their symptoms:</p>

<p><img alt='A &lt;- B -&gt; C' src='/assets/img/pgm/flu.png' /></p>

<p>Or the events surrounding a traffic jam:</p>

<p><img alt='A -&gt; B &lt;- C -&gt; D' src='/assets/img/pgm/trafficjam.png' /></p>

<p>Each node represents a random variable, and the arrows represent dependence relations between them. You can think of a node with incoming arrows as a probability distribution parameterized on some set of inputs; in other words, a function from some set of inputs to a probability distribution.</p>

<p>PGMs with directed edges and no cycles are specifically called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network'>Bayesian networks</a>, and that&#8217;s the kind of PGM I&#8217;m going to focus on.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to translate a Bayesian network into code using this <a href='https://github.com/jliszka/probability-monad'>toy probability library</a>. All we need are the observed frequencies for each node and its inputs. Let&#8217;s try the traffic jam graph. I&#8217;ll make up some numbers and we&#8217;ll see how it works.</p>

    <h2 class='title'>Unlikely things happen all the time</h2>
    <p>Yesterday I received an unexpected media query from Jen Doll, a journalist at New York Magazine, reporting on the story where Frank Bruni found Courtney Love&#8217;s iPhone in a taxi. She was musing about the statistical likelihood of an event like that, and somehow found <a href='http://replyz.com/c/2552117-does-anyone-know-the-probability-of-getting-the-same-nyc-cab-driver-twice'>this twitter thread</a> where I had calculated the probability of getting the same cab driver twice. She wanted to know how I arrived at my figures and whether I had any additional insight on the question.</p>

<p>So of course I wrote her back a whole essay, and today <a href='http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/long-odds-of-getting-courtney-loves-taxi.html'>there&#8217;s this article</a>. Her editors had cut it way down, <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/english-has-a-new-preposition-because-internet/281601/'>because journalism</a>. But I had put all this work into it, so I thought I&#8217;d post it here.</p>

    <h2 class='title'>The Foursquare Theorem</h2>
    <p>This has nothing to do with the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_square'>playground game</a>, the <a href='http://www.foursquare.org/'>church</a>, or the <a href='https://foursquare.com'>mobile/social/local city guide</a> that helps you make the most of where you are. (Disclosure: I work at Foursquare.)</p>

<p>This is about <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem'>Lagrange&#8217;s four-square theorem</a>, which states that every natural number can be expressed as the sum of four squares. For example, <script type='math/tex; mode=display'>

<p>The proof given on the Wikipedia page is only an existence proof, but I was able to find a <a href='http://www.alpertron.com.ar/4SQUARES.HTM'>mostly constructive proof</a> elsewhere online. I want to present an outline of the proof along with some code that carries out the construction. Here&#8217;s a preview:</p>

    <h2 class='title'>Painless, effective peer reviews</h2>
    <p>Peer reviews are the most effective kind of feedback — only your peers really know what it&#8217;s like to work with you, and they have the most insightful, nuanced and helpful suggestions for improvement. Almost every tech company I can think of does them as part of their annual review process. The problem is that everyone hates writing them, because decent feedback takes a really long time to write, sometimes on the order of 4 or 5 hours for a single peer review.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to solve this problem. Most people think that there&#8217;s a natural, unavoidable relationship between quality and time spent. But that overlooks an important point — the thing that makes writing peer reviews difficult is: writing itself.</p>

    <h2 class='title'>Infinite lazy polynomials</h2>
    <blockquote class='quote'>
  <p>"Never underestimate the insights encoded into the coefficients of a polynomial!"</p>
  —Steven Rudich
</blockquote>
<p>In this post I&#8217;m going to write a toy library for manipulating infinite lazy polynomials. I promise this will be fun.</p>

<h3 id='representation'>Representation</h3>

<p>You might try representing a polynomial of infinite degree as an infinite stream of coefficients. But I think it would be easier to think about it in terms of a function <script type='math/tex'>c:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</script> that gives you the coefficient for a given power of <script type='math/tex'>x</script> in the polynomial. So the polynomial represented by some function <script type='math/tex'>c</script> would be</p>
<script type='math/tex; mode=display'>

</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Poly</code> class just wraps a function of type <code>Int =&gt; Double</code>, memoizes it, and provides a <code>toString</code> representation including the first so many coefficients.</p>

<p>Now we can create instances like this:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; val one = new Poly(n =&gt; if (n == 0) 1 else 0)
one: Poly = { 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ... }

scala&gt; val x = new Poly(n =&gt; if (n == 1) 1 else 0)
x: Poly = { 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ... }</code></pre>

<p>You can access arbitrary coefficients by calling the <code>apply</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; x(0)
res0: Double = 0.0

scala&gt; x(1)
res1: Double = 1.0

scala&gt; x(12)
res2: Double = 0.0</code></pre>

<p>Just keep in mind that <code>p(n)</code> is the coefficient of <script type='math/tex'>x^n</script> in <code>p</code>, not <script type='math/tex'>p(n)</script> (i.e., <script type='math/tex'>p</script> evaluated at <script type='math/tex'>n</script>) as you might expect to see. I can get away with this because I&#8217;m probably never going to evaluate these polynomials, I&#8217;m just going to treat them formally, as mathematical objects in their own right. (To get my terminology straight, as some commenters have pointed out, these objects are called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_power_series'>formal power series</a>.)</p>

    <h2 class='title'>Exact numeric nth derivatives</h2>
    <p>Automatic differentiation is a well-studied technique for computing exact numeric derivatives. Dan Piponi has a <a href='http://blog.sigfpe.com/2005/07/automatic-differentiation.html'>great introduction on the subject</a>, but to give you an overview, the idea is that you introduce an algebraic symbol <script type='math/tex'>\newcommand\e\epsilon\e</script> such that <script type='math/tex'>\e \ne 0</script> but <script type='math/tex'>\e^2 = 0</script>. Formulas involving <script type='math/tex'>\e</script> are called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number'>dual numbers</a> (e.g., <script type='math/tex'>1 + \e</script>, <script type='math/tex'>3 - 5\e</script>) in much the same way as complex numbers are formulas involving the algebraic symbol <script type='math/tex'>i</script>, which has the property <script type='math/tex'>i^2 = -1</script>.</p>

<p>Then you teach the computer how to add, subtract, multiply and divide with dual numbers. So for example, <script type='math/tex'>(1 + \e)(3 - 5\e) = 3 + 3\e - 5\e - 5\e^2 = 3 - 2\e</script> (since <script type='math/tex'>\e^2 = 0</script>). The computer keeps everything in &#8220;normal form,&#8221; i.e., <script type='math/tex'>a + b\e</script>, as you go along.</p>

<p>In order to find the derivative of some function <script type='math/tex'>f</script> at a point <script type='math/tex'>x</script>, all you have to do is compute <script type='math/tex'>f(x + \e)</script>. The answer you get (in normal form) is</p>
<script type='math/tex; mode=display'>
%<![CDATA[
f(x + \e) = f(x) + f'(x)\e
%]]>
</script>
<p>So for example, let <script type='math/tex'>f(x) = x^2</script> and let&#8217;s find <script type='math/tex'>f'(3)</script>. To do this, we compute <script type='math/tex'>f(3 + \e)</script>:</p>
<script type='math/tex; mode=display'>
%<![CDATA[
\begin{align}
f(3 + \e) &= (3 + \e)^2 \\
 &= 9 + 6\e + \e^2 \\
 &= 9 + 6\e
\end{align}
%]]>
</script>
<p>We expected <script type='math/tex'>f(3 + \e) = f(3) + f'(3)\e</script>. Equating these two results, we can conclude that <script type='math/tex'>f(3) = 9</script> and <script type='math/tex'>f'(3) = 6</script>. Which is true!</p>

<p>This works not just for simple polynomials, but for any compound or nested formula of any kind. Somehow dual numbers keep track of the derivative during the evaluation of the formula, respecting the chain rule, the product rule and all.</p>

<p>The reason this works becomes clearer when you consider the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series'>Taylor series</a> expansion of a function:</p>
<script type='math/tex; mode=display'>
%<![CDATA[
f(x + p) = f(x) + f'(x)p + \frac{f''(x)p^2}{2!} + \frac{f^{(3)}(x)p^3}{3!} + \ldots
%]]>
</script>
<p>When you evaluate <script type='math/tex'>f(x + \e)</script>, all the higher-order terms drop out (because <script type='math/tex'>\e^2 = 0</script>) and all you&#8217;re left with is <script type='math/tex'>f(x) + f'(x)\e</script>.</p>

<p>I claim to have a function <code>H</code> that maps any integer-valued function you give it to a different integer. That is, an injection from <code>Int =&gt; Int</code> to <code>Int</code> that returns a different <code>Int</code> for every function you give it.</p>

<p>This is clearly impossible, since there are way more functions from integers to integers than there are integers. But I demand proof in the form of witnesses <code>f: Int =&gt; Int</code>, <code>g: Int =&gt; Int</code> and <code>n: Int</code> such that <code>H(f) == H(g)</code> and <code>f(n) != g(n)</code>.</p>

<p>Your job is to write a function <code>solve</code> that takes a single argument <code>H: (Int =&gt; Int) =&gt; Int</code> and returns <code>f</code>, <code>g</code> and <code>n</code> as described above.</p>

<p>One approach is to put together a mathematical proof that such an injection is impossible and try to extract a program from that proof à la the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence'>Curry-Howard isomorphism</a>.</p>

<p>This is a continuation of my <a href='/2013/08/26/a-programmers-guide-to-the-central-limit-theorem.html'>previous post on the Central Limit Theorem</a>.</p>

<p>Say you&#8217;re designing a new feature for your website and you can&#8217;t decide which shade of blue to use. So you let your users decide by trying both — some users see <span class='blue1'>this shade</span> and some users get <span class='blue2'>this one</span>. Whichever group of users spends more time on the site will determine which color you end up going with.</p>

<p>You run your experiment for a little while and collect the following data:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Group</th><th>Shade of blue</th><th># of users</th><th>Average time on site</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>A</td><td style='text-align: left;'><span class='blue1'>this one</span></td><td style='text-align: left;'>1,028</td><td style='text-align: left;'>91.4 seconds</td>
</tr><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>B</td><td style='text-align: left;'><span class='blue2'>this one</span></td><td style='text-align: left;'>1,015</td><td style='text-align: left;'>103.8 seconds</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>Looks like group B did better! But it&#8217;s a small difference, how can you be sure it&#8217;s significant? In other words, assuming that the shade of blue had no effect on the amount of time a user spends on the site, what is the probability that you would have observed a difference of 11.4 seconds? In <em>other</em> other words, given the distribution of the amount of time different users spend on the site, if you draw 2 samples of 1,000 or so from this distribution, what is the probability that you would see a difference of 21.4 (or more) in the averages of the samples?</p>

<p>Well, you would expect that that depends a lot on the distribution. Here is the distribution you observed:</p>

    <h2 class='title'>How traffic actually works</h2>
    <p>Every so often <a href='http://www.smartmotorist.com/traffic-and-safety-guideline/traffic-jams.html'>this article</a> makes the rounds and it annoys me. That isn&#8217;t how traffic works and the proposed solutions won&#8217;t fix anything. Maybe you can eliminate the annoying stop-and-go, but no one gets home any faster. In fact you can prove that you and everyone behind you get home strictly later than if you had just gone along with the stop-and-go traffic.</p>

<h3 id='the_facts'>The facts</h3>

<p>Here&#8217;s how traffic works. First, we know from <a href='http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/operations/tft/chap2.pdf'>empirical studies</a> that drivers tend to maintain a minimum following distance, measured in seconds. It varies per driver, but typically it&#8217;s somewhere between 1.5 and 2 seconds. That works out to a maximum theoretical flow rate of between 1,800 and 2,400 vehicles per lane per hour passing by a given point on the highway. Studies of actual highway traffic have measured flow rates as high as 2,000 vehicles per lane per hour, which works out to a following distance of 1.8 seconds. (I&#8217;m just going to call it 2 seconds for the sake of round numbers.)</p>

<p>The important fact: <strong>there is a limit to the number of cars that can pass by a given point on the highway in a given amount of time, and that limit is one car every 2 seconds, per lane</strong>. So imagine you are in heavy traffic during rush hour. There are a certain number of cars in line in front of you. Let&#8217;s pick a point on the road to call the front of the line — say, the point at which you plan to exit the highway. The line gets shorter by one car every 2 seconds. If there are 1,000 cars in front of you, it&#8217;s going to take a minimum of 2,000 seconds for you to get to the front of the line. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether people are kind and let cars merge in front of them, zipper-style. It doesn&#8217;t matter how much stop-and-go there is. The simple fact is that it takes 2 seconds per car for you to get to the front of the line, and there are some cars in front of you that have to get there before you do.</p>
