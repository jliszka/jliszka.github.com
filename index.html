    <h2 class="title">Probability is in the process</h2>
    
<p>I came across an old post by Eliezer Yudkowsky on Less Wrong entitled <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/">Probability is in the Mind</a>.
It immediately struck me as, well, <em>more</em> wrong, and I want to explain why.</p>

<p>A brief disclaimer: that article was published 8 years ago and he may have changed his thinking since then,
but I’m purely out to address the idea, not the person. So here goes.</p>

<p>First I’ll lay out his argument, which he does through a series of examples.</p>

    <h2 class="title">The quantum eraser demystified</h2>
    
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment">quantum eraser</a> is a variation on the classic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_slit_experiment">double-slit experiment</a>.
If you ever have any doubt about the weirdness of quantum mechanics (“oh, there’s probably some classical explanation
for all of this”), this experiment is designed to remove it.</p>

<p>The experiment involves two entangled polarized photons. The first goes straight to a detector, and the second passes
through a barrier with two slits before reaching a detector.</p>

<p>The experiment proceeds in three stages. I’m going to simulate each stage using my
<a href="https://github.com/jliszka/quantum-probability-monad">toy quantum computing library</a> (see
earlier post <a href="/2013/09/09/the-3-things-you-should-understand-about-quantum-computing.html">here</a>), and we’ll see what happens!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Had a chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/jliszka">@jliszka</a> about Bayes&#39; rule, the &#39;14 draft lottery, &amp; the chances the NBA is rigged.

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This chat basically consisted of Harry mentioning that the Cleveland Cavaliers got the first pick in the draft,
even though the lottery gave them only a 1.7% chance of drawing that slot, then wondering aloud how he should update his
prior on whether the NBA draft is rigged given this information, and then me breaking out my <a href="/2013/09/03/fun-with-bayesian-priors.html">probability monad</a>,
because there’s no problem that can’t be solved with more monads.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Programming with futures: patterns and anti-patterns</h2>
    
<p>Twitter’s Future library is a beautiful abstraction for dealing with concurrency. However, there are
code patterns that seem natural or innocuous but can cause real trouble in production systems. This short
article outlines a few of the easiest traps to fall into.</p>

<h3 id="an-example">An example</h3>

<p>Below is a method from a fictional web application that registers a user by calling the Foursquare API
to get the user’s profile info, their friend graph and their recent check-ins.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Good Tech Lead, Bad Tech Lead</h2>
    
<p>A brief guide to tech leadership at Foursquare, inspired by Ben Horowitz’s
<a href="http://benhorowitz.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/good-product-manager.pdf">Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager</a>.
Cross-posted from <a href="https://medium.com/p/948b2b806d86">Medium</a>.</p>

<h3 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h3>

<p>Good tech leads act as a member of the team, and consider themselves successful when the team is successful. They take
their share of unsexy grungy work and clear roadblocks so their team can operate at 100%. They work to broaden the
technical capabilities of their team, making sure knowledge of critical systems is not concentrated in one or two minds.</p>

<p>Bad tech leads take the high-profile tasks for themselves and are motivated by being able to take credit for doing the
work. They optimize locally, keeping team members working on projects that benefit the team at the expense of the
engineering organization at large.</p>

<h3 id="technical-vision">Technical vision</h3>

<p>Good tech leads have an overall vision for the technical direction of the product and make sure the team understands it.
They delegate feature areas to other team members and let them own their decisions. They recognize that their team
members are smart, trust them, and rely on them to handle significant pieces of the project.</p>

<p>Bad tech leads resist explaining or clarifying the technical direction and dictate decisions instead. They keep critical
institutional knowledge in their heads, failing to multiply their effectiveness by creating and disseminating helpful
documentation.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Bayesian networks and causality</h2>
    
<p>Correlation does not imply causality—you’ve heard it a thousand times. But causality does imply correlation. Being
good Bayesians, we should know how to turn a statement like that around and find a way to infer causality from
correlation.</p>

<p>The tool we’re going to use to do this is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model">probabilistic graphical model</a>.
A PGM is a graph that encodes the causal relationships between events. For example, you might construct this
graph to model a chain of causes resulting in someone getting a college scholarship:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pgm/sat.png" alt="A -&gt; B -&gt; C" /></p>

<p>Or the relationship between diseases and their symptoms:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pgm/flu.png" alt="A &lt;- B -&gt; C" /></p>

<p>Or the events surrounding a traffic jam:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pgm/trafficjam.png" alt="A -&gt; B &lt;- C -&gt; D" /></p>

<p>Each node represents a random variable, and the arrows represent dependence relations between them. You can think of
a node with incoming arrows as a probability distribution parameterized on some set of inputs; in other words,
a function from some set of inputs to a probability distribution.</p>

<p>PGMs with directed edges and no cycles are specifically called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian networks</a>,
and that’s the kind of PGM I’m going to focus on.</p>

<p>It’s easy to translate a Bayesian network into code using this <a href="https://github.com/jliszka/probability-monad">toy probability library</a>.
All we need are the observed frequencies for each node and its inputs.
Let’s try the traffic jam graph. I’ll make up some numbers and we’ll see how it works.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Unlikely things happen all the time</h2>
    
<p>Yesterday I received an unexpected media query from Jen Doll, a journalist at New York Magazine, reporting on the story where
Frank Bruni found Courtney Love’s iPhone in a taxi. She was musing about the statistical likelihood of an event like
that, and somehow found
<a href="http://replyz.com/c/2552117-does-anyone-know-the-probability-of-getting-the-same-nyc-cab-driver-twice">this twitter thread</a>
where I had calculated the probability of getting the same cab driver twice.
She wanted to know how I arrived at my figures and whether I had any additional insight on the question.</p>

<p>So of course I wrote her back a whole essay, and today
<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/long-odds-of-getting-courtney-loves-taxi.html">there’s this article</a>.
Her editors had cut it way down,
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/english-has-a-new-preposition-because-internet/281601/">because journalism</a>.
But I had put all this work into it, so I thought I’d post it here.</p>

<p>The text of my reply is below.</p>

    <h2 class="title">The Foursquare Theorem</h2>
    
<p>This has nothing to do with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_square">playground game</a>, the
<a href="http://www.foursquare.org/">church</a>, or the <a href="https://foursquare.com">mobile/social/local city guide</a> that helps you
make the most of where you are. (Disclosure: I work at Foursquare.)</p>

<p>This is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem">Lagrange’s four-square theorem</a>, which states
that every natural number can be expressed as the sum of four squares. For example,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
%&lt;![CDATA[
\newcommand\m[1]{\text{ }(\text{mod }#1)}
123456789 = 2142^2 + 8673^2 + 6264^2 + 2100^2
%]]&gt;
</script></p>

<p>The proof given on the Wikipedia page is only an existence proof, but I was able to find a
<a href="http://www.alpertron.com.ar/4SQUARES.HTM">mostly constructive proof</a>
elsewhere online. I want to present an outline of the proof along with some code that carries out the construction.
Here’s a preview:</p>

    <h2 class="title">Painless, effective peer reviews</h2>
    
<p>Peer reviews are the most effective kind of feedback — only your peers really know what it’s like to work with you, and
they have the most insightful, nuanced and helpful suggestions for improvement. Almost every tech company I can think of
does them as part of their annual review process. The problem is that everyone hates writing them, because decent
feedback takes a really long time to write, sometimes on the order of 4 or 5 hours for a single peer review.</p>

<p>I’d like to solve this problem. Most people think that there’s a natural, unavoidable relationship between quality and
time spent. But that overlooks an important point — the thing that makes writing peer reviews difficult is: writing
itself.</p>

<h3 id="the-interview-method">The interview method</h3>

    <h2 class="title">Infinite lazy polynomials</h2>
    
<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>"Never underestimate the insights encoded into the coefficients of a polynomial!"</p>
  —Steven Rudich
</blockquote>

<p>In this post I’m going to write a toy library for manipulating infinite lazy polynomials. I promise this will be fun.</p>

<h3 id="representation">Representation</h3>

<p>You might try representing a polynomial of infinite degree as an infinite stream of coefficients. But I think it would be
easier to think about it in terms of a function <script type="math/tex">c:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</script> that gives you the coefficient
for a given power of <script type="math/tex">x</script> in the polynomial. So the polynomial represented by some function <script type="math/tex">c</script> would be</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
%<![CDATA[
p_c(x) = c(0) + c(1)x + c(2)x^2 + c(3)x^3 + \ldots
%]]>
</script>

<p>The <code>Poly</code> class just wraps a function of type <code>Int =&gt; Double</code>, memoizes it, and provides a <code>toString</code>
representation including the first so many coefficients.</p>

<p>Now we can create instances like this:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; val one = new Poly(n =&gt; if (n == 0) 1 else 0)
one: Poly = { 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ... }

scala&gt; val x = new Poly(n =&gt; if (n == 1) 1 else 0)
x: Poly = { 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ... }
</code></pre>

<p>You can access arbitrary coefficients by calling the <code>apply</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; x(0)
res0: Double = 0.0

scala&gt; x(1)
res1: Double = 1.0

scala&gt; x(12)
res2: Double = 0.0
</code></pre>

<p>Just keep in mind that <code>p(n)</code> is the coefficient of <script type="math/tex">x^n</script> in <code>p</code>, not <script type="math/tex">p(n)</script> (i.e.,
<script type="math/tex">p</script> evaluated at <script type="math/tex">n</script>) as you might expect to see. I can get away with this because I’m probably never
going to evaluate these polynomials, I’m just going to treat them formally, as mathematical objects in their own right.
(To get my terminology straight, as some commenters have pointed out, these objects are called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_power_series">formal power series</a>.)</p>
