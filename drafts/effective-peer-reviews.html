      <p>Peer reviews are the worst. Most people I know dread the prospect of having to write one. The kind I&#8217;m talking about is where you nominate a handful of your co-workers, and your manager collects their written feedback, usually in the form of 2 or 3 free-response questions, and delivers it in some form to you along with their own synthesis and additional feedback. This is pretty common in the tech industry. It&#8217;s what Google and Facebook do, and a lot of startups opt for it by default.</p>

<p>Peer feedback is the most effective kind of feedback, if done well. Only your peers really know what it&#8217;s like to work with you, and they have the most insightful, nuanced and helpful suggestions for improvement. The problem is that good feedback takes a really long time to write. It&#8217;s not uncommon to take 4 or 5 hours to write a single peer review, and that can stretch out over a period of a week or more if you&#8217;re an expert procrastinator.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to solve this problem. You might think that there&#8217;s a natural tradeoff between quality and time spent, that the higher quality you demand, the more time it will take. So there&#8217;s certainly no way to get higher quality reviews in <em>less</em> time. That&#8217;s asking too much! Wait, what about in a <em>quarter</em> of the time?</p>

<p>This is all possible, and as a manager I&#8217;ve done it probably 25 times in the last year. The thing to realize is, the only thing that makes writing good peer reviews difficult is: writing itself.</p>

<h3 id='the_interview_method'>The interview method</h3>

<p>Here are 5 easy steps to collecting effective, insightful, critical, honest peer review feedback in about an hour:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Schedule a meeting.</strong> The manager conducting the review sets up a 30 minute 1-on-1 meeting with the peer reviewer. <em>Time: 30 seconds</em>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Prepare notes.</strong> Before the meeting, the peer reviewer takes a few minutes to jot down some notes about the reviewee, going through emails, code commits, and their own recollections. <em>Time: 10 minutes</em>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Interview.</strong> During the meeting, the reviewer talks about the reviewee, and the manager writes down everything they say, as verbatim as possible. The manager guides the discussion by asking clarifying questions or bringing up broad topics (think &#8220;How would you characterize Joe&#8217;s impact on the organization?&#8221; not &#8220;Joe breaks the build all the time, what do you think about that?&#8221;). <em>Time: 30 minutes</em>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Edit.</strong> After the meeting, the manager turns their notes into written, readable English, of the quality that you would see in a regular written review. This consists of two parts: copy editing (fixing typos, supplying connecting words, expanding abbreviations, removing redundancies) and organization (rearranging the sentences and paragraphs into common themes — people do tend to ramble). <em>Time: 15 minutes</em>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Get approval.</strong> The manager shows the finished review to the reviewer for approval. The reviewer makes sure that their thoughts are being accurately represented and that they are comfortable with the content of the review, and makes any necessary edits. <em>Time: 5 minutes</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You&#8217;re done! Total elapsed time: one hour. Total person-hours: one hour and 30 minutes.</p>

<h3 id='why_this_is_great'>Why this is great</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s efficient. There&#8217;s nothing like getting 4 hours of your life back, and given the choice, potential peer reviewers will jump for it every time, and will thank you for it.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no loss of fidelity — written reviews produced this way are typically of equal if not higher quality than those produced by traditional means. In my experience, it&#8217;s pretty rare for the reviewer to make significant changes in the &#8220;approval&#8221; step — usually it&#8217;s just a phrase here or there.</p>

<p>But on top of this, you also get things in an interview that the reviewer would have never written down in the first place. Interviewing someone is a remarkably effective way of getting honest feedback out of them, particularly critical feedback. For some reason, people filter their thoughts when they write, but not so much when they speak. Certain things that they would hesitate to write down, they have no trouble saying aloud.</p>

<p>You also tend to get a lot more volume from people who don&#8217;t think they have much to say, or who would normally write very little. I think one reason for this is that writing interrupts your train of thought. Sometimes, by the time you finish writing the first half of your thoughts, you&#8217;ve forgotten the second half.</p>

<p>This method also removes the possibility of procrastination (at least on the part of a peer reviewer). If you&#8217;re sitting in a room with someone, you&#8217;re not going to go off and check twitter or get distracted. As a manager this is reassuring — just put something on the calendar, and you know the reviewer&#8217;s work will be done by the end of that meeting.</p>

<h3 id='why_it_works'>Why it works</h3>

<p>So much of writing is putting yourself in your reader&#8217;s shoes and handling possible objections or misinterpretations — you&#8217;re not going to be there when they read it, so you have to cover your bases. This is a taxing, laborious process. Having someone there to give you immediate feedback short circuits much of it. The manager will do this instinctively by giving subtle non-verbal cues to the reviewer that lets them know whether what they&#8217;re saying makes sense. This frees up the reviewer to just speak their mind without the burden of having to figure out how precisely to word it.</p>

<p>I think what&#8217;s going on here is that humans are just wired to speak to other humans. When you think about it, writing things down is a fundamentally unnatural act. If you want to get quick access to the thoughts in someone&#8217;s head, you talk to them in person. And I think there&#8217;s something about just having another person in the room that turns on a circuit in your brain that makes you a better communicator.</p>

<h3 id='common_objections'>Common objections</h3>

<p>People are naturally pretty skeptical of this process when they first hear about it. I was surprised by its effectiveness, too, at first!</p>

<p><strong>Isn&#8217;t this more work for the manager conducting the review?</strong><br /> Yes, but it&#8217;s mostly mindless work. Copy editing is not the same thing as creating insightful sentences from whole cloth; the manager is polishing and rearranging existing material, not creating it. It does certainly involve more clock time for the manager, about an hour per reviewer.</p>

<p>But the upside is that it dramatically decreases the load on peer reviewers, by a factor of 3 or more. That frees them up to do their actual job — which, to me, is what being a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership'>servant-leader</a> is all about. Besides, if I can&#8217;t spend 3-5 hours per report per <em>year</em> as a manager to get them the best feedback I can, what am I doing?</p>

<p><strong>Won&#8217;t the manager bias the reviewer during the interview?</strong><br /> It is a theoretical concern, but in practice the manager is too busy typing to do much else. There is certainly room for a malicious manager to do some damage here. But if you don&#8217;t trust your managers, you have bigger problems, right?</p>

<p><strong>Aren&#8217;t peer reviewers going to shy away from being critical in person?</strong><br /> This is what surprised me the most. It turns out that critical feedback flows much more freely in a face-to-face discussion than it does in writing. I can&#8217;t really explain it, except that perhaps people are wary of committing criticism to writing. When they see it on the page in black and white, attributed to them, they freak out a little bit and change it. When speaking off the cuff, their thoughts tend to come out less filtered.</p>

<p>One peer reviewer, looking back at the notes I had taken after a particularly critical review, remarked to me, &#8220;Wow, there&#8217;s no way I would have written these things down. It&#8217;s brutally honest and blunt — but I&#8217;m happy with it, because this is how I felt, this is what I said.&#8221;</p>

<h3 id='pro_tips_for_managers'>Pro tips for managers</h3>

<p>This technique takes a little bit of practice. You shouldn&#8217;t expect your first review to come out perfect in an hour — there&#8217;s a decent amount of trial and error that goes into it. But here are some tips to help you avoid some of the mistakes I made early on:</p>

<p><strong>Keep the conversation in a helpful place.</strong> The whole purpose of this is to find ways to help people improve. If you&#8217;re hearing a lot of unconstructive complaining, you can keep it on track by asking, &#8220;what should X be doing differently here?&#8221; or &#8220;so what&#8217;s your advice for X?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Ask questions to keep things moving along.</strong> Most of the time, reviewers have no shortage of things to say, but sometimes a little prompting goes a long way. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Can you elaborate on that?&#8221;</li>

<li>&#8220;Can you give me an example of that?&#8221;</li>

<li>&#8220;Can you talk about X&#8217;s impact on the org/technical skill/ability to get things done/communication skills?&#8221;</li>

<li>&#8220;What could X do to be even better?&#8221;</li>

<li>&#8220;What&#8217;s the one piece of advice you have for X?&#8221;</li>

<li>&#8220;What else?&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Editing is critical.</strong> There&#8217;s a big difference between the way people talk and the way people read. Bridging the gap is your job as the manager conducting the review. The goal is to make the prose as readable as possible while retaining the original meaning. This means that paraphrasing is sometimes necessary, but you should avoid it if you can. More commonly, you&#8217;ll just want to trim down rambling or duplicated sentences or ideas. When people talk, they often retread over the same idea multiple times using different words. As a diligent note-taker, you&#8217;ve written them all down. Feel free to pick one or two of them and delete the rest.</p>

<p>But most often, you&#8217;ll just be turning your notes into Proper English Sentences. To give you an idea what I mean, here is what I typed during one actual interview:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;very storng design sense about how these things should work, can comm htem effectively and clearly. this works and this works, but this one is better bc it will let us do x y and z down the road.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here&#8217;s the final result:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;He has a very strong design sense about how things should work and can communicate them effectively and clearly. For example, maybe there are two solutions that work, but he&#8217;ll articulate that one of them is better because it allows us to do more things down the road.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It involved a little paraphrasing, but it improved clarity without changing the meaning. I think that&#8217;s as far as you&#8217;ll want to go in paraphrasing, though.</p>

<p>Luckily, the fallback is that the reviewer gets final say as to what goes into their review. If you accidentally misrepresent them in what you type up, they have the opportunity to correct it.</p>

<p><strong>Reorganizing is critical.</strong> This is one step beyond editing. People retread the same topics and touch on the same themes throughout the interview. You&#8217;ll just want to group together things that are related. You can do it by topic (technical skill, communication, leadership, getting things done, detail-oriented) or by subject (accomplishments, things they&#8217;re good at, things to work on). But the point is that the review should lay out a coherent story and should not jump around between topics, even if that&#8217;s what the reviewer did during the interview. It&#8217;s much more important that the review is delivered effectively than that it is 100% true to what the reviewer said in the order they said it.</p>

<h3 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been conducting annual reviews this way for almost a year, with overwhelmingly positive results. Reviewers uniformly and enthusiastically prefer it, and reviewees don&#8217;t notice the difference (I always give them the choice, though). The only times it hasn&#8217;t gone as well were my own fault, due to insufficient editing of my notes into a coherent review.</p>

<p>Anyway, try it out, and let me know what you think!</p>
