### State vectors

The state of a quantum system is represented by a vector. You're probably familiar with vectors in 2-space or 3-space:

{% math %}
v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \\
w = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
{% endmath %}

which is really

{% math %}
v = x + 3y \\
w = 3x - y + 2z
{% endmath %}

with {%m%}x{%em%}, {%m%}y{%em%}, and {%m%}z{%em%} being basis vectors in each of the 3 dimensions.

### Measurement

### Inner product

### Tensor product

### Outer product
