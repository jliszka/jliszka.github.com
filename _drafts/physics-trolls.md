### Airplane on a treadmill

By the way, most people are under a mistaken impression about how airplanes fly. Usually the explanation involves
air travelling faster over the top of the wing, having to "catch up" to the air below the wing, or some magic involving
high pressure under the wing and low pressure above it, but these explanations are wrong (or misleading at best).

Thinking back to Newton's Second Law, in order for an airplane to stay up in the air, it must be pushing something down
with a force equal to the weight of gravity on the airplane. That something is air. The wings of the airplane are
throwing such a volume of air at such a speed that it creates an equal and opposite force on the wings, keeping the
airplane aloft. The wings do this with a simple trick called entrainment â€” any fluid flowing over a surface becomes
entrained to the surface and will follow it as it curves (up to a point). You can demonstrate this with your finger
under a faucet. The exact same principle applies to air. The top of a wing curves downward. As air flows over it, it
follows the curve around and flows downward as it leaves the trailing edge of the wing.

There is a limit to this effect though. If the curvature of the surface is too extreme, or the air is flowing too fast,
entrainment breaks and the air no longer follows the surface. In aviation, this is called a stall.
