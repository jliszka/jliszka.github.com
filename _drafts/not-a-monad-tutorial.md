I'm not going to tell you that "a monad is like a dream," but the quote above does encapsulate the basic idea of a monad:
a monad is a container (you can put anything in it) with a flattening rule (a container of containers is just a container).

If you've never encountered monads before, that description is unlikely to be helpful â€” it's a description, not an
explanation. Instead of trying to explain monads, I'm just going to show you a ton of examples of monads, and the magical
human brain between your ears will do what it does best: extract a pattern. And at the end I will tell you that
that that pattern is called "a monad."
